# Contract requests

Standing backlog for work the design side cannot do without backend, state,
or ViewModel functionality that does not exist yet. Each entry logs the
feature blocked, the missing functionality Nick would need to build or
expose, and the design intent once it exists. Design never builds the fix
itself here; it stubs the UI honestly or pauses the affected component and
logs the gap below.

Scope note: a contract file created by a branch, inside a package nothing
outside it consumes, is presentation and stays editable under the normal
rules. This backlog is for shared contracts, anything Nick owns, and
anything genuinely blocked on backend work.

## Open requests

### CR-001, movement_style missing from creator form schema

Feature blocked: the heart stop's behavior field reads and writes
`movement_style` (`components/studio/create/character/BehaviorStep.jsx`),
but `movement_style` is not a key in the creator form's initial field set
(`components/studio/create/character/constants/form.js`, 53 keys).

Missing functionality: `constants/form.js`'s `initialForm` needs a 54th key,
`movement_style`, with a default value and a signed contract entry
describing its shape and versioned name.

Design intent once it exists: the field continues to render exactly where
it does today; no new UI is required, only the schema catching up to what
is already wired.

### CR-002, rendering_style missing from creator form schema

Feature blocked: the seal stop and the review step read `rendering_style`
(`review-step/useCharacterReviewStepViewModel.js`,
`review-step/CharacterReviewStep.fixtures.js`), but `rendering_style` is
not a key in `constants/form.js`'s initial field set either.

Missing functionality: whether to add `rendering_style` as a 55th field is
a schema decision Nick and Brian need to rule on together; not decided here.

Design intent once it exists: same as CR-001, the field renders where the
review step already expects it once the schema carries the key.
